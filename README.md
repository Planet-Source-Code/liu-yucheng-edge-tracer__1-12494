### Description

UPDATED!!

Does a really impressive Edge Trace operation on a picture.

It has 2 modes of Edge Tracing.

B&W Edge Trace: Any pixel with a difference larger than the Edge Threshold Value is set to Black

GrayScale Edge Trace: Also shows how much difference is there.

Now has 2 modes of edge tracing. One is more accurate. The other produces finer and sharper edge traces though less accurate.

(Thanks for your feedback Rang3r!!)

Any comments for improvement?
